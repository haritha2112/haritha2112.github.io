# My Website
This is the source for my personal website hosted on Github pages :metal:

### Setup
The source files are located in the react-source directory. When the project is built from this directory, the build artifacts are stored in the project root directory. The project is structured in this way to work with Github User pages.

Go to the source directory
```sh
cd react-source
```

Install dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```

Start development server
```sh
$ npm start
```

Generate build artifacts
```sh
$ npm run build
```
